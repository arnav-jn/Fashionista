# Fashionista

##Abstract:

We begin by scraping the Flipkart website to acquire product information such as T-shirts, 
dresses, and skirts. We then assign a score to each of these items based on the number of 
reviews and ratings. After calculating the final score for each product, we look for the most 
popular and liked product in each category. 

Then, using Twitter sentimental analysis, we acquire information about the trending 
keywords pertaining to each category (for instance e have t-shirts, skirts, and dresses). This 
provides us with a list of all the social media hashtags that are currently popular and 
relevant to the specific product.

Finally, we map the top trending keywords to our Flipkart dataset consisting of final product 
score along with product details like product name and URL and display the top 5 products 
according to the trending tags with their URL to the user.
